# Extracted Data

Extracted Data are the feature vectors extracted from the raw `.mp3` audio files.

They are stored here for persistence so to avoid having to recompute features on
each run. Instead, the clustering algorithm simply reads the feature vectors from
here.


## Filesystem

Place and categorise your extracted playlists here. The filesystem structure is
important for extracting metadata and running the program.

- Each playlist is a folder.

- Folder names will be treated as playlist names.

- Only `.pkl.pbz2` files will be read.

- Files with `.features` in their name represent a Pandas dataframe with only feature 
vectors.

- Files with `.representations` are Pandas dataframe with only visual representations
stored as objects.

- Format is independent of the `data/raw` folder unless generated by the
`processAllPlaylists.py` script.

Please also see the [Raw Data](/data/raw/README.md) folder.


## Converting Raw `.mp3` to `.data`

- Please see the [Scripts Documentation](/scripts/README.md).
