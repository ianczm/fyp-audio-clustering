# Raw Data

Place the raw `.mp3` audio files here so that they can be easily found and converted into Extracted Data (`.data`) files.

This directory is optional, as raw audio files are not needed for the clustering process.

[//]: # (Todo: processAllPlaylists should be able to process the entire raw folder)
