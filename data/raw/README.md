# Raw Data

Place the raw `.mp3` audio files here so that they can be easily found and
converted into feature vectors and representations.

This directory is optional, as raw audio files are not needed for the clustering
process.


## Filesystem

The filesystem structure here is important only if you are automatically converting
the folders of raw `.mp3` into feature vectors using the provided
[scripts](/scripts/README.md).

- Each playlist is a folder.

- Folder names will be treated as playlist names.

- Only `.mp3` files will be read.

- The folder structure here will be replicated in `data/raw` folder.

Please also see the [Extracted Data](/data/extracted/README.md) folder.


## Converting Raw `.mp3` to `.data`

- Please see the [Scripts Documentation](/scripts/README.md).
