## Dissertation Abstract

_Taken from the Final Year Project Report._

This project introduces music clustering as an unsupervised method of generating music recommendations,
where songs are represented by spectral and harmonic features extracted directly from its audio,
aiming to produce highly similar recommendations as the reference song.

Data flows through a pipeline comprised of Multidimensional Scaling and Principal Component Analysis
for dimensionality reduction, the Gaussian Mixture Model for clustering as well as the t-Distributed
Stochastic Neighbour Embedding and k Nearest Neighbours for visualisation and recommendation generation.

This project demonstrates that clustering is indeed a viable option for generating recommendations,
grouping a dataset of 425 songs into 8 clusters that closely represent the 8 playlists that the songs were
originally selected from. This gives hope that with a better feature set, it would be possible to generate
consistent and highly similar recommendations, allowing users to discover new music without having to
condense their search result into human-readable words that might dilute the musical meaning behind
the search.
